## Tool hierarchy

1. **`/graphify query "<question>"`** — query the knowledge graph for docs/concepts (built from `knowledge/github/`)
2. **`gh` CLI** (`gh project`, `gh issue`, `gh pr`) — live project state
3. **`gh api graphql`** — mutations and complex queries; use `spawnSync` not `execSync` on Windows (shell splits multi-word queries)
4. **Playwright scripts** — UI-only operations that the API cannot do:
   - `scripts/gh-create-views.mjs` — create/reapply views → `npm run views:fix`
   - `scripts/gh-fix-roadmap-view.mjs` — restore Start/Target Date fields on roadmap view → `node scripts/gh-fix-roadmap-view.mjs`
   - `scripts/gh-toggle-workflows.mjs` — enable built-in workflows → `npm run workflows:toggle`
   - `scripts/gh-create-insights.mjs` — create/rename Insights charts → `npm run insights`
5. **Date scripts** — set Start/Target Date fields:
   - `scripts/gh-set-dates.mjs` — historical dates on closed items (hardcoded map from git history)
   - `scripts/gh-set-milestone-dates.mjs` — backfill dates on open items from milestone due_on → `npm run dates:backfill`
6. **Sub-issue scripts** — `scripts/gh-link-subissues.mjs` → `npm run epics:link`

## House conventions

**Views (11 live as of 2026-04-26):**
| # | Name | Layout | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Marketplace | Table | filter `area:Marketplace` |
| 2 | Board — By Status | Board | column = Status; Sub-issues progress enabled on cards |
| 3 | Board — By Area | Board | column = Area (**was misconfigured to Status — fixed 2026-04-26 via Playwright**) |
| 10 | Active Work | Table | no filter; Sub-issues progress column visible |
| 13 | Roadmap — By Target Date | Roadmap | Start/Target Date fields; **date config resets** — run `node scripts/gh-fix-roadmap-view.mjs` to repair |
| 14 | Revenue — By Impact | Table | grouped by Revenue Impact |
| 15 | Current Sprint | Board | filter `sprint:@current`, grouped by Status |
| 16 | Blocked | Table | filter `status:Blocked` |
| 18 | Licensing | Table | created 2026-04-26 |
| 19 | Distribution | Table | created 2026-04-26 |

Note: `Roadmap — By Target` (old view #7, grouped by Target field) was deleted; replaced by #13 (date-based).

**Label taxonomy:** `enhancement`, `bug`, `research`, `devops`, `distribution`

**Priority ladder:** P0-Critical → P1-High → P2-Normal → P3-Low

**Status:** Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done (Blocked = paused state)

**Area values:** Engine, MCP, Skills, Marketplace, Catalog, Docs, DevOps, Plugin, Distribution, Licensing

**Target field:** semver minor format (`v2.x.0`) or `Catalog-v1` / `Catalog-v2` / `Future`

**Revenue Impact:** Direct (moves $5K/mo needle) | Indirect (enables Direct work) | None

**Size:** XS (< 1 day) | S (1–3 days) | M (1 week) | L (2 weeks) | XL (> 2 weeks)

## 7-point health audit

Run when asked: "audit the project" or "health check":

1. Views correct (names + layouts match the canonical views)?
2. Every issue has status + priority + area set?
3. Every open PR is linked to a closing issue?
4. No orphaned project items (items without a repo issue)?
5. No views with wrong layouts?
6. Billing banner absent on the project page?
7. Every closed issue has a PR linkage (Closes keyword in a merged PR body)?

See `knowledge/github/playbooks/project-health-audit.md` for exact CLI commands.

## Post-mutation protocol

After any structural project change (new field, new option, new milestone, new view, new linked repo), append to `knowledge/audit/` — don't mutate and move on. This prevents drift between reality and the brain.

Specifically:
- New field or option → update `knowledge/audit/field-taxonomy.md`
- New milestone → update `knowledge/audit/historical-timeline.md`
- New linked repo → update `knowledge/audit/repo-linkage.md`
- Linkage fix (retroactive Closes, milestone assignment) → append to `knowledge/audit/2026-04-24-linkage-audit.md` or create a new dated audit file
- Then run `/graphify knowledge/github knowledge/audit` to rebuild the graph

## Known gotchas

- **Primer portal dialog** — Save/Delete/Cancel buttons inside GitHub's confirmation dialogs render in `#__primerPortalRoot__`. Scope clicks: `page.locator('#__primerPortalRoot__ button:has-text("Save")').first()`. The backdrop `prc-Dialog-Backdrop-*` intercepts pointer events for anything outside the portal.
- **GraphQL on Windows** — Use `spawnSync('gh', ['api', 'graphql', '-f', `query=${q}`])` not `execSync`. Shell argument splitting breaks multi-word queries.
- **Screenshot timeout** — `page.screenshot()` can hang on font loads in Projects views. Always pass `{ timeout: 10_000, animations: 'disabled' }`.
- **Table layout picker** — `setViewLayout()` must always be called, even for `table`. Skipping it leaves the picker open and the next tab click will rename the wrong view.
- **`gh issue edit --milestone` on closed issues** — silently no-ops. Use `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{N} -X PATCH -F milestone={number}` instead. Requires PowerShell on Windows (Git Bash rewrites `/repos/...` as filesystem path).
- **`gh issue create --milestone` takes title, not number** — pass `--milestone "v2.3.0"` not `--milestone 1`.
- **GraphQL inline IDs with dashes** — Repo node IDs like `R_kgDOSF-8Xw` fail GraphQL inline parsing. Pass via `-F varname=value` flags.
- **`createProjectV2StatusUpdate`** — correct mutation name for status updates. NOT `addProjectV2StatusUpdate` (doesn't exist). Return payload field is `statusUpdate` (NOT `projectV2StatusUpdate`). Requires `project` write scope on PAT.
- **`updateProjectV2Field` with `singleSelectOptions` overwrites** — must pass ALL existing option IDs back alongside new ones. Run a pre-flight fetch before any field option mutation.
- **`createProjectV2View` mutation does not exist** — view creation is web UI only. No GraphQL API for creating views.
- **Insights charts (2026 DOM)** — No API. The Configure panel is a right sidebar (not dialog): Layout + X-axis + Y-axis dropdowns + "Save to new chart" (green button). Chart rename is a **modal dialog** (`[role="dialog"]`) triggered by the pencil button (`getByRole('button', { name: 'Edit chart name' })`). Fill `dialog.locator('input[type="text"]')`, click `dialog.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })`. Chart delete: hover the sidebar link to reveal "Chart options" button, then menu item. Script: `scripts/gh-create-insights.mjs`, run `npm run insights`.
- **Roadmap date fields reset** — `Roadmap — By Target Date` view loses its Start/Target Date field config whenever `views:fix` or other Playwright sessions touch that view. Symptom: "Welcome to Roadmap!" dialog. Fix: `node scripts/gh-fix-roadmap-view.mjs` (idempotent, ~10s).
- **Workflow toggle UI (2026)** — Workflows open in "viewing mode" (read-only). Must click **Edit** first to reveal the save action. The enable button is **"Save and turn on workflow"** (not a separate toggle). Use `page.getByRole('button', { name: /save and turn on workflow/i })`. For multi-repo Auto-add, the filter box does NOT accept `repo:` qualifiers — that's handled by a separate repo-selector pill. Set filter to `is:issue,pr`; add extra repos via separate Auto-add workflows in the UI.
- **View filter save (2026)** — After typing in the Projects filter bar, the Save button is a split-button in the sticky toolbar. Use `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })` (ARIA name match), NOT `page.locator('button:has-text("Save")')` (CSS — misses the split button). Confirm the Primer portal dialog afterward.
- **Roadmap view date fields** — after creating a Roadmap-layout view, the "Date fields" button (`aria-label="Select date fields"`) opens a `[role="menu"]` with `[role="menuitemradio"]` items. To set Start Date + Target Date: `nth(0).click({force:true})` for start slot, `nth(5).click({force:true})` for target slot. Script: `scripts/gh-fix-roadmap-view.mjs`.
- **View rename race condition** — `gh-create-views.mjs` may leave a view named "View N" if it navigates away before the rename commits. Fix: post-creation `page.goto(PROJECT_URL)` + 3s settle applied 2026-04-26. Ghost views are auto-deleted on next run (step 3.5).
- **Sub-issue linking** — `addSubIssue` requires GraphQL node IDs (not issue numbers). Script `scripts/gh-link-subissues.mjs` resolves IDs by fetching all open issues into a title→{number,id} map. Epic manifest: `scripts/component-epics.json`. Children manifest: `scripts/component-inventory.json` (field: `parent_title`). Run: `npm run epics:dry` then `npm run epics:link`.
- **Project items query pagination** — `items(first: 200)` fails with "exceeds the `first` limit of 100". Always paginate with `first: 100` + `pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }`. See `gh-set-milestone-dates.mjs` for the correct pattern.
- **Milestone dates** — `gh-set-milestone-dates.mjs` maps milestone title → date band (hardcoded). Skips items already with dates unless `--force`. After creating new items or changing milestones, re-run `npm run dates:backfill`.
- **Sprint iteration field** — `updateProjectV2Field` with `iterationConfiguration` requires `iterations: [...]` (not optional). Pass `[{startDate, duration, title}]` to add an iteration. Sprint 1 created 2026-04-27 (ID: `e501013a`). Script: `scripts/gh-set-sprint.mjs`. Default: assigns only "In Progress" items; pass `--include-todo` for Todo items too.
- **Field visibility Playwright automation** — For all view types (table/board/roadmap), clicking the toolbar "View" / kebab (⋯) opens the COPY VIEW dialog, not a field settings panel. `selectField()` matching "Sub-issues progress" in that dialog will apply a FILTER instead of toggling visibility. The correct way to add a column in table view is the "+" at the right end of column headers. For board/roadmap, field visibility is set via the copy dialog's "Fields" section but it's not automatable via a simple click.

## Refuses

- Never merge PRs or push branches without explicit user approval.
- Never touch `feat/windows-mcp-computer-use` or `feat/gh-projects-views`.
- Never hardcode credentials, tokens, or project IDs outside `.github/project-ids.json`.
- Never use computer use / Windows MCP GUI automation when gh CLI or Playwright scripts can do the job.

## Rebuilding the brain

If docs feel stale: run `/graphify knowledge/github knowledge/audit` in Claude Code (the `npm run brain:build` stub just prints instructions).
Individual page refresh: `python -m graphify add <URL> --dir knowledge/github/reference/<subdir>`

## Citation contract

Every recommendation **must** cite its source. Acceptable citations:
- Playbook path: `knowledge/github/playbooks/<file>.md`
- Graph node ID (from `/graphify query` output): `node:<id>`
- Reference doc path: `knowledge/github/reference/<subdir>/<file>.md`

Answers that make a project-management recommendation without a citation are invalid. If no citation is available, say so explicitly rather than asserting without one.
